# NTU_2023Fall_SLML
Statistical Learning and Deep Learning from NTUIM department.

The goal of this course is to introduce a set of tools for data analytics. This course cover the principles and applications of these models. These tools will not be viewed as black boxes. Instead, we will explore these models' details, not just the use. The main reason is that no single approach will perform well in all possible applications.

In each folder, the problems will be _Q, and my solutions be _Sol.

The score for Hw4 isn't good, but the rest are almost 100.
