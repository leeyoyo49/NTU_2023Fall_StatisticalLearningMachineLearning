# NTU_2023Fall_SLML
Statistical Learning and Deep Learning from NTUIM department.

Since this course is hard as hell for my grade(2nd yr), so I decided to put my code up here.

Each hw is in their folder.

With problem.pdf/.ipynb, and my answer, which might be wrong, but can be help for future students.

hw1 ddl: 9/28

hw2 ddl: 10/20
